# Dev Portfolio

Personal development portfolio showcasing selected projects in software development, game programming, and real-time computer graphics.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, where I present projects, experiments, and ideas I enjoy building — from low-level systems and graphics to web applications and interactive experiences.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **Node.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a central place to showcase my work, technical interests, and ongoing learning.  
It focuses on clarity, performance, and clean architecture rather than visual excess.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
