# Dev Portfolio

Personal development portfolio showcasing selected projects in software engineering, game development, and real-time graphics programming.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website — a place where I document projects, experiments, and technical explorations ranging from low-level systems and rendering engines to modern web applications and interactive tools.

The focus is not just presentation, but clarity, performance, and clean architecture.

## ✨ Philosophy

This portfolio follows a few core principles:

• Clean and readable code  
• Performance-first mindset  
• Minimal and functional design  
• Strong technical substance over visual noise  
• Built with modern tools, engineered with care  

The goal is to present real engineering work, not just screenshots.
